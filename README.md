## Target-group backgrounds prove effective at correcting sampling bias in maxent models
Step by step code for analysing sampling bias data from the hoverfly recording scheme. Each script has been numbered, and should be used in that order. The script that may be most useful is "4_creating_bias_files.R", which has the code to re-create target-group bias files in the same manner. It is also worth noting that code has been streamlined for parallel computing, but this may not be feasible on all computers. Instead code can be run sequentially, although this may take significantly more time. Please email me (r.barber@kew.org) if there is any part of the code that needs further explanation.
